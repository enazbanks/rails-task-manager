Question 25 / 31 - Now you want to add reviews to your app. Here are some constraints:
-We don’t want our visitors to destroy or update reviews, just to create ones.
-We don’t want a separate index page to list all reviews or a show page to display each review. Instead, we want to display reviews on the show page of each song, for better UX.
-Generate your Review model in the terminal. It should have only a content:string and a song:references (the foreign key)
